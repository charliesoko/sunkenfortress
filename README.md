# _The Sunken Fortress_
## A competitive Quake map by Charlie Sokolovsky

##### _Within the grounds of a once-great castle, an excavation unearthed an ancient object said to corrupt the minds of men. As those that discovered the relic fought amongst themselves, the fortress fell into ruin. Now, with crumbling towers and sunken tunnels, the castle plays host to a new group of warriors that will once again fall victim to the chaos that the dark artifact manifests around itself._

##### The Sunken Fortress is a work-in-progress Quake deathmatch map for 2-4 players. It is set within an ancient castle that has fallen into ruin, forcing players to navigate dilapidated towers and crumbling pathways as they fight to stay alive.
